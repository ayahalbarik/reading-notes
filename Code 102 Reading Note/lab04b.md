# introduction
**The 4 things common to all computers 
1. **input**
converts physical input to binary information
2. **memory**
sstorage 
3. **processing**
in CPU  central processing ,have many cpu & storage (GIGA) claculate information
4. **output**
 convers information to physical 

## binary &data (one &zero)
inside the computer there are wires and circuits to convert all the information in computer

in now the using electricity by on & off ,0&1 ,yes &no ......its called a**bit**

## what about text ,image ,sound and video
1. text each letters have number 
2. image using pixel and *RGB* ,each pic have million of pixel ,but video have +3millon pixel each minute 
3. sound waveform using #no & can be brokendown into series of #no 

### logical gates like 
AND ,NAND 
OR ,NOR
NOT
SO, YOU CAN USE ONE AND MORE LOGICAL GATES BY BUT CIRCUITES SIDE BY SIDE ,TO ADD TOGETHER MUCH LARGE no 

#### hardware and software master of controls all the other parts of the computer 
its do math & logic and send & receive 

in the past thes using binary code ,but now using bython or more of language
